# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome! This README provides an overview of project management processes used by OctoAcme and links to all structured process documentation.

## Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme runs projects using a customer-first, iterative approach that emphasizes clear ownership, data-driven decisions, and psychological safety. Our framework ensures teams deliver value efficiently while maintaining transparency and fostering continuous improvement.

The project lifecycle follows five key phases: **Initiation** validates goals and stakeholders, creating a lightweight plan; **Planning** breaks work into shippable increments with clear acceptance criteria; **Execution** involves daily standups, demos, and continuous quality checks; **Release** standardizes deployment with rollback plans and verifications; and **Retrospective** captures learnings and converts them into actionable improvements. Throughout this lifecycle, we maintain regular communication cadences including daily standups, weekly syncs, and milestone-based stakeholder updates.

Core roles include Project Sponsors who provide strategic direction and resources, Project Managers (PMs) who coordinate delivery and manage risks, Product Managers (PdMs) who define outcomes and prioritize the backlog, Business Analysts who bridge stakeholder needs with project goals, Developers who implement features and collaborate on design, QA Leads who oversee testing strategy and quality gates, Communications Specialists who manage stakeholder messaging and updates, Risk Managers who focus on risk identification and mitigation, and Stakeholders who provide inputs and approvals. Each role works collaboratively to ensure projects deliver on commitments while maintaining high quality standards.

Quality assurance is embedded throughout our process with unit tests for new logic, integration and end-to-end testing for critical flows, security scanning in CI, and defined acceptance criteria for every deliverable. We track progress through velocity metrics, burndown charts, and success metrics identified during project initiation, ensuring we remain data-informed at every step.

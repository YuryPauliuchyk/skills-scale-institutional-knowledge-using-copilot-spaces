# OctoAcme — Risk Management & Communication

## Purpose
Explain how to identify, manage, and communicate risks and dependencies. The Risk Manager leads risk management activities, while the Communications Specialist coordinates stakeholder communications.

## Risk Register
Maintain a simple table with:
- ID
- Description
- Impact (High/Med/Low)
- Likelihood (High/Med/Low)
- Owner
- Mitigation plan
- Status

## Risk Lifecycle
- Identify: during planning and ongoing execution (led by Risk Manager with input from all team members)
- Assess: estimate impact and likelihood (Risk Manager coordinates with relevant subject matter experts)
- Mitigate: reduced via actions, contingency plans (Risk Manager tracks mitigation efforts)
- Monitor: review at weekly syncs and update status (Risk Manager provides updates to Project Manager)

## Stakeholder Communication
- Identify stakeholder groups and communication needs (e.g., engineering, sales, support)
- Provide regular updates (weekly or milestone-based) coordinated by Communications Specialist
- Use a single source of truth (project README or release doc) for status
- Communications Specialist maintains stakeholder maps and ensures consistent messaging

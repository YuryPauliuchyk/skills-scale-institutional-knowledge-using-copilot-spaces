2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (Business Analyst supports requirements elicitation)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) with input from QA Lead
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map
